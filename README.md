# Parallel-Program-Design---Pthread

Pthread Implementation.
Step by Step and learn the How pthread work.

Compile:

using "gcc −g −Wall −o execute source −lpthread"to compile the pthread

And then use "./execute number_of_thread" to make several thread to run.

=======================================================================================

Step1 : HelloWorld.

Step2 : HelloWorld and do some test on parameter into the thread function.

Step3 : Do the parallel program of smoothing graph .

P.S. : 
Program in pthread didn't need to do the boundary problem by itself.
